# pythonTools

A collection of Python tools for networking and security tasks.

## Description

This repo contains various Python scripts I have written to assist with network analysis, penetration testing, and general network administration.

## Tools

- **netcat.py:** A Python implementation of the classic netcat utility.
- **tcpServer.py:** A simple TCP server for handling multiple client connections.
- **tcpClient.py:** A basic TCP client for connecting to servers.

## Usage

Each tool includes detailed comments and example usage within the script itself. Refer to the script's documentation for specific instructions. This is my attempt to create a more structured project. Put the mess away.
